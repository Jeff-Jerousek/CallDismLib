# CallDismLib

An expamle project calling Windows Deployment Imaging Service Management I COM API.

This COM library is much more powerful than the diffuse POP DISM API, and it don't need the huge ADK.

AND! Its typelib has been registered beforehand on every Windows PC!

The only shortcoming is that...

Windows Deployment Imaging Service Management is not documented...
